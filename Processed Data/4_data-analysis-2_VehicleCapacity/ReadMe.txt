One concern was the difference in capacity between EV and ICEV freight vehicles. Therefore, we examined the actual sample to see if there was a significant difference.

From the websites of auto manufacturers and others, we extracted as many freight vehicles of the type used for parcel delivery as possible and organized their GVWR (lbs), Payload (lbs), and Carrgo Capacity (ft3), which are summarized in "les.xlsx".

Using the data, I performed a regression analysis of GVWR and Payload and tested whether there was a significant difference between the two coefficients by t-test. The results showed no significant difference. These were conducted in Stata using the "Test for the relation of GVWR and Payload by engine type.do".
